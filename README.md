# rabbda-earthquakes-portal

## Introduction
This is a proof of concept application that aims to demonstrate how Big Data can be used to create complex Big Data solutions.
Additionally, by implementing various releases, we present how a project evolves through multiple iterations.

__RABBDA project:__

RABBDA (Reduce Access Barriers to Big Data Analytics) is created by the [Centre of Parallel Computing](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/centre-for-parallel-computing) - University of Westminster.

The project objective is to provide students and practitioners access to Big Data technologies and learning material. The earthquakes portal is designed to serve RABBDA project as an illustration on how to utilise Big Data technologies so to build complex architectures.

RABBDA is the first attempt to merge a Science Gateway with a KREL (knowledge repository and learning), called [SMARTEST](https://smartest-repo.herokuapp.com/) to facilitate the comprehension of the various aspects of the portal.
